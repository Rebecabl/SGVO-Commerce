# E-Commerce Project with SQL Server

This project is a simulation of an E-Commerce system implemented on Microsoft SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It includes the creation of tables for customers, products, orders, order items, categories, and payments. The goal is to provide a basic structure for an e-commerce system, enabling simple queries and analyses on customers, sales, and products.

## Key Features

| Feature              | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customers**        | Customer registration with information such as name and email.                                |
| **Products**         | Product registration containing name, price, and category.                                    |
| **Orders**           | Generation of orders associated with customers, including date information.                  |
| **Order Items**      | Relationship between orders and products, indicating quantity and unit price.                |
| **Categories**       | Classification of products into categories.                                                  |
| **Payments**         | Recording of payments associated with orders, including amount, payment method, and date.    |

## Exemplified Queries

The project includes exemplified SQL queries demonstrating how to extract useful information, such as the best-selling products, customers who make the most purchases, and the average spending per customer.

## Use of COLLATION in SQL Server

Queries and sorting in this project use COLLATION to handle case sensitivity and accentuation issues, ensuring correct data sorting and comparison.

This project serves as a useful tool for understanding basic data modeling concepts for e-commerce, specifically tailored for the SQL Server environment. It can be extended and adapted to specific needs within this environment.
